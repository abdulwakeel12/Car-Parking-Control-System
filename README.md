## 📖 Introduction

With increasing vehicle populations in cities, efficient parking systems are essential. This project is designed to replicate a simple but effective parking control system using logic implemented through transistors and switches.

---

## 🧰 Components Used

- Resistors (1kΩ, 5kΩ)
- SPST Switches
- NPN & PNP BJT Transistors
- JFET Transistor
- DC Motor (5V)
- Connecting Wires
- Breadboard
- 9V Battery
- LEDs

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The system is divided into two main parts:
- **Parking Area Control**: SPST switches represent each parking slot. The presence or absence of a vehicle is simulated with ON/OFF states.
- **Gate Control**: A combination of JFET and BJT transistors along with an H-Bridge circuit controls a DC motor for the gate.

If parking slots are full, the system stops the gate motor and turns off the indicator LED. When slots are available, the LED lights up and the gate motor is allowed to rotate.

---

## ✅ Results

- Accurate indication of empty and full parking slots.
- Functional gate mechanism controlled by transistor logic.
- LED indicators provide clear visibility of parking status.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

While basic in design, this project demonstrates how fundamental electronic components can be used to build a simple logic-based parking system. Lack of advanced sensors or microcontrollers was compensated with clever use of transistor logic (JFET & BJT), creating a semi-intelligent parking management solution.
